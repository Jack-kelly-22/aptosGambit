# The Gambit Protocol

The Gambit Protocol is our flagship game that combines social deduction, strategic decision-making, and risk management into an engaging multiplayer experience.

## Game Structure

### Entry Phase
- Players join with entry stake
- Minimum 4 players, maximum 10 players
- Prize pool forms from combined entry stakes
- Small protocol fee deducted for ecosystem sustainability

### Core Gameplay Loop

#### Round Structure
1. **Voting Phase** (15 seconds)
   - All players vote simultaneously
   - Votes remain hidden until phase ends
   - No communication during voting

2. **Action Phase**
   - Majority decision executed automatically
   - Results displayed to all players
   - Pot and player statuses updated

3. **Discussion Phase** (30 seconds)
   - Players can communicate
   - Form alliances or plan strategies
   - Prepare for next round

## Available Actions

### 1. GAMBLE
- Risk 50% of current pot
- 1.8x return on success
- Smart contract determines outcome
- All players share risk and reward

### 2. ELIMINATE
- Vote to remove one player
- Target loses entry stake
- Remaining players split their share
- Requires majority consensus

### 3. SPLIT
- Divide pot equally among players
- Ends game immediately
- Requires unanimous agreement
- Safe but potentially lower return

### 4. BANK

- Amount divided among active players
- Reduces future potential rewards
- Cannot be lost once banked
